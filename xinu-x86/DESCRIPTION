This directory contains a modifiction of the Linksys code that has
been ported to the x86 and a 3com Ethernet driver added.  In this
version, the interrupt mechanism has been replaced by one that uses
the Interrupt Flag in the processor FLAGS register (i.e., the bit
set with cli/sti).  It still maintains a global interrupt mask for
the controller that specifies which devices are allowed to interrupt,
but it only sets the interrupt mask when a new interrupt handler is
added (e.g., at device initialization time).

The Ethernet driver includes multicast, but it is not yet integrated
with ethControl (i.e., one has to call eth_mcadd separately.
